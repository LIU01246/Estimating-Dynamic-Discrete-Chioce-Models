# Estimating-Dynamic-Discrete-Chioce-Models
This project replicates the Nested Fixed Point Algorithm used by John Rust in his 1987 seminal paper "Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher‚Äù. Then, I estimate Rust's results using Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (henthforce BBL, 2007) methods.
